# Learning to Load 3D Models with React and Three.js
This repository is a learning journey for those who want to master the art of loading and manipulating 3D models in React applications using the Three.js library. We explore a variety of fundamental features, providing a comprehensive and practical understanding of essential techniques.

# Key learning features:
GLTFLoader and useLoader: Learn to use useLoader and GLTFLoader to load 3D models in your React application, providing a solid foundation for efficient manipulation and rendering.

Primitive and Custom Models: Experience creating custom 3D objects using primitives and custom models, including using the { model.scene } object to incorporate loaded models.

Ambient Lights: Discover how to add ambient lighting to your models, increasing the visual quality of the scene and creating immersive atmospheres.

Slow Loading with Suspense: Implement slow loading in your application using Suspense to manage asynchronous loading of 3D models, along with fallback strategies to ensure a seamless user experience.

GLTF for 3D Visualization: Utilize the GLTF format to display 3D models efficiently and optimally, leveraging preloading features to improve performance.

PMNDRS Market Integration: Explore integrating the PMNDRS Market into your workflow, installing 3D models directly into your project using the npx gltfjsx command.

Animations with useAnimation: Add movement and life to your 3D models using the useAnimation feature to create dynamic and interactive animations.
